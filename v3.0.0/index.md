üóûÔ∏è **AutoType has converted from JavaScript to TypeScript!**<br/>
Although the bot has fully converted to TypeScript, the migration of commands is still not yet complete. View the last section for details.<br/>

üì§ **Stays online, 24/7!**<br/>
AutoType has been hooked up to a hosting service and should now be online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! The only time the bot should randomly go offline is if some changes are being made to it or if there is a server outage, which is extremely unlikely to happen.<br/>

# :gear: Changes<br/>
‚Ä¢ New logo design! (view the bot's new profile picture)<br/>
‚Ä¢ `=ping` now shows a third latency (Received), which measures how long it takes to fetch the current date when receiving the command<br/>
‚Ä¢ `=rps` now supports multiplayer with new embeds and interactions!<br/>
‚Ä¢ `=info` has been upgraded featuring an overview, background info, and statistics (deprecating `=support` and `=version`)<br/>
‚Ä¢ `=aes` has been remodeled and no longer requires external NPM dependencies<br/>
‚Ä¢ `=help beta` is now out of beta and will be the default help menu from now on!<br/>

# :sparkles: New Additions<br/>
‚Ä¢ Added `=define`: Look up the definition and synonyms of a word!<br/>
‚Ä¢ Added `=unix` for easy access to unix time (seconds since 1/1/1970)<br/>
‚Ä¢ Added `=standoff`, a new game that tests your reflexes<br/>
‚Ä¢ Added `=hash`, `=salt`, and `=hmac` as cryptography tools<br/>

# ‚ö†Ô∏è **Status Notice**<br/>
Some commands may be unoperational during this week due to internal migrations and will either be re-added or discontinued in the future. These include but are not limited to: `=lottery`, `=slots`, `=roulette`, `=path`, `=add`, `=subtract`, etc. You can check which commands are available for use by using `=help`. More information will be released in the next update.
